I have not had a problem with that,  since I love the fact that many folks still enjoy it.   However,  with the recent incessant attacks and flash support getting "complicated",  it just is no longer sustainable for us to continue running HI1.   To this end,  we are getting it back online one more time, restored to morning of oct 17th and extending everyone's subscriptions by 30 days, and suggesting that folks say their goodbyes over the next few weeks.
<BR><BR><B>We do not recommend purchasing anything from the store</B> from now on,  as the server could close at any time in the future.  We have removed the year sub and currency options but will leave store open in case someone needs something to enjoy final days.
<BR><BR>Thanks everyone for having a fun adventure with us,  and I wish it could have continued!  <br>-Joe and Miranda<BR><BR><B>[ September 19, 2020 ] <FONT COLOR=880000>Horse Isle 1 Compromise</FONT>:</B><BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deja vu

Unfortunately, some troublemakers made a mess of HI1 Again.<BR>We have reverted to a backup from 4am PST and taken some additional precautions. So, anything you "did" this morning was reverted.<br>We have also given all subs +24hrs to cover the down time.<br><br>Because passwords for accounts were likely compromised, we setup a system to verify and unlock for players' protection. When you try to login you will be prompted to reset your password.  We can automatically unlock most players' accounts, but some will require manual support via email.  Just follow the directions and please be patient with us.<br><br>Sorry about the trouble.  HI1 was never designed to survive so long into this new mean digital world. ;)     The only thing these "Cracks" accomplish is getting us closer to having to close down HI1.<BR><BR><B>[ June 23, 2020 ] <FONT COLOR=880000>Horse Isle 1 Compromise</FONT>:</B><BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, some troublemakers made a mess of HI1.<BR>We have reverted to a backup from 4am PST and taken some precautions.
