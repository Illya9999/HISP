<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold; COLOR:#990000">RULE FOLLOWING:</span><br/>
The Horse Isle game is a Web Browser Based Flash Game where players may play
with virtual horses and interact with real players in a virtual world. To make
it enjoyable for all, we do not allow players to harass others, use rude,
obscene or obnoxious language, or in any way degrade the enjoyment of the game
for others.&nbsp; All of the posted Horse Isle Rules must be followed.&nbsp;

website.<br/>

</span>Unpaid players may have their access limited to the site and some game
features.&nbsp; Fees and privileges may be changed at any time without
notice.&nbsp; There are <span style="TEXT-DECORATION:underline">no refunds for
ANY Horse Isle membership fees</span>.&nbsp; There are no 'holds' offered for
membership terms.<br/>
<br/>
We will remove old accounts from our system as we see fit.  Unsubscribed members that 
have not accessed their accounts within 60 days will have their account deleted. 
You can delete your account at any time(by providing ample proof of ownership), however there are no refunds for 
payments already made (wholly or partly) and
you will lose the remaining subscription time.&nbsp; 
&nbsp; Instead you may use up any time left on the account that is paid and just not pay to renew services.&nbsp; Horse Isle does not ever bill for services, all payments are prepaid, initiated by account holder. All payments must be from your own funds with parental consent.  Our current playername change policy is one name change for subscribers only.<br/>

have been breached, or that it is necessary in order to prevent or stop any harm
or damage to us, Horse Isle, other players or the general public or to minimize
our liability to others, we reserve the right with or without prior notice to
(amongst other things): to Terminate the account or modify any or all accounts
of Horse Isle which we think are connected with you and/or otherwise block your
access to our websites and services and take such other steps as we consider
reasonable. Such actions may result in loss of membership credit without refund.<br/>
