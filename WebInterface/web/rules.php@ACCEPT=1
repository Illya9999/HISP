  Rules</span></font><br/>
</div>
<CENTER>For an exhaustive policy list,  please read <A HREF=rulesdetail.php>DETAILED RULES</A></CENTER>
<br/>
Punishment for breaking the rules can range from a warning, to you losing your
account and having your IP blocked, to the authorities being notified.&nbsp; Know the rules and follow
them.&nbsp; It will make the game more enjoyable for you and others.  You are 100% responsible for your 
own account.  If another person/sibling plays on your account and earns you violations, this is your 
responsibility,  If they get you banned, It is considered your fault. So do NOT allow others to play 
on your account. <br/>

<br/>
<font size="3" style="COLOR:#990000"><span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">[RULE
#1]</span></font><span style="COLOR:#990000">&nbsp;
</span><b style="COLOR:#990000">No Swearing or Adult Topics</b><br/>
This is an all-ages, friendly environment.&nbsp; Remember that and speak as
though your mother, grandmother and 7 year old sister were all watching.<br/>
No violent, offensive or inflammatory language.&nbsp; This includes religious
proselytizing, racial comments, ethnic stereotypes, political statements, etc.<br/>
No date-speak allowed. This is not a dating site, no boyfriend/girlfriend talk allowed. This includes talking about or referencing sexual orientation.<BR>
There is a filter set up to catch swearing or to change some other words.&nbsp;
DO NOT cheat the filter by going around it.<br/>
Because we need to monitor the chat all chat must be in English.<BR>
All chat is recorded and monitored by Administrators, <b>Including Private Chat</b>.
Keep it clean and family friendly everywhere.<br/>
<b><br/>
<font size="3" style="COLOR:#990000">[RULE
#2]</font><span style="COLOR:#990000"> </span></b><b style="COLOR:#990000">No
Sharing Personal Info</b><br/>
<b>NEVER share your Horse Isle password!</b>&nbsp; NO ONE from Horse Isle staff will
ever ask it from you.&nbsp; Never enter it on another website either!<br/>
No sharing of Email addresses/IM accounts<br/>
No sharing of Websites<br/>
No sharing of Phone/Cell numbers<br/>
No advertising of any kind<br/>
No sharing your age or asking for another player's age<br/>
No sharing Real Names / Home Addresses / Home Towns.--&nbsp;
Countries/States/Provinces are as detailed as we permit such communication.<br/>
Limit your contact and friendships to IN-GAME only. This is for your and other
peoples' safety.&nbsp; NEVER trust anyone met online.<br/>
<font size="3"><br style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold"/>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold; COLOR:#990000">[RULE
#3]</span></font><b><span style="COLOR:#990000"> No Ruining Fun For
Others</span><br/>
</b>No harassing/bullying other players.&nbsp; Do Not tease, make
fun of, call names, etc.&nbsp; The old, <span style="FONT-STYLE:italic">"if you
don't have anything nice to say..&nbsp; don't type."</span>.<br/>
Players may not form "herds" or gangs with the intent of harassing, stalking or otherwise intimidating other players. This includes forming hate groups or participating in any sort of violent behavior. Any players found to be taking part in such activities will be muted by the mods and receive violation points in accordance with the severity of the offense.<br>
If someone does insult you, DO NOT respond.&nbsp; This will just make the
situation worse.&nbsp; If it was serious (breaking Rule #1) report the person to
a moderator or admin.&nbsp; You can do this directly or by filling out an
"Abuse" report.&nbsp; A recent chat log will be sent with the report, so the
offense must occur within that log.<br/>
Use the MUTE button on players that annoy you.&nbsp; DO
NOT let it escalate to a problem.<br/>
No Spamming/Flooding Chat by repeating the same thing over and over or by typing random letters or symbols.<br/>
No typing in all caps.  This is considered yelling and rude.<br/>
There is an Auto-Sell and auction systems to sell horses.&nbsp; Please use that
instead of spamming the global chat.  There is even an 'Ads Only' channel specifically for selling things.  This should be used for any ads instead of global chat.<br/>
There are riddles and passwords in the game.  If you need help with either of them please do so in a private message.  Many people may want to figure these things out on their own and don't want to hear the answer over global chat.<br/>
<b>This is a positive environment. Anyone not
respecting others may receive a chat violation by Admins.</b><br/>
<b><br/>
</b><b style="COLOR:#990000"><font size="3">[RULE #4]</font> No
Cheating</b><span style="COLOR:#990000">. </span><br/>
<B>ONLY ONE ACCOUNT PER PLAYER!</B>.  Players found with more than one account will have all accounts deleted and banned from the game.<br/>
Do not move, or help another player move, money/horses to another account.  Doing so is seriously breaking the rules and could get your account deleted.<BR>
No 'giving away' horses, money or items when you quit the game.  If you do not want to play anymore, everything should remain on your account.  (See Detailed Rules for more.)<br>
If you find a bug and report it, you will be rewarded, with both respect and
probably an in-game reward.<br/>
If you find a bug and take advantage of it, that's cheating, and you could lose
your account.<br/>
Do not use any type of automated click/repetition tools.  Instant permanent ban when detected.<BR>
<br/>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold; COLOR:#990000"><font size="3">[RULE #5]</font>
Parental Permission</span><br/>
Anyone under 18 should have parental permission to play.&nbsp;<br/>
We <span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold">REQUIRE</span> anyone under 13 to absolutely
have parental permission.&nbsp;<br/>
Many parents enjoy playing the game with their own account also!<br/>
<br/>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold; COLOR:#990000"><font size="3">[RULE #6]</font>
Play Smart</span><br/>
Never make a trade on a promise.&nbsp; Always make trades that are fair in
themselves.&nbsp; (Don't give someone one of your horses with their promise they
will give it back, etc.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
Do not trade for a present because it could contain anything.<BR>
Do not trade something you are not willing to lose.<br/>
Do not buy or sell accounts.  This is not only considered trading on a promise, but is an easy way to get scammed.<br>
Never give out your password.&nbsp; Be in the habit of never even typing it
except for when logging into the game.<br/>
Do not share accounts with other players.  Remember you are 100% responsible for your account, so don't let someone else ruin it for you.<br>
Don't EVER EVER EVER agree to meet another player in real life.<br/>
Take breaks.&nbsp; Do not sit and play for hours straight.&nbsp; Try to break up
game time with other activities.&nbsp; This will make the game more fun in the
long run.<br/>
<font size="3"><br/>
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold"></span></font><span style="FONT-WEIGHT:bold"><font size="3" style="COLOR:#990000">Sending
an Abuse Report</font><br/>
</span>The abuse report will send the report that is filled out by the player
along with a short chat log.&nbsp; The broken rule must have occurred within
that chat log.&nbsp; An abuse report should ONLY be sent if it is a serious rule
break.&nbsp; Some examples include harassment, pushing someone for detailed personal
information and getting extreme profanity around the filter.&nbsp; DO NOT send
an abuse report for simple name calling, because another player is annoying you
or a player not being fair with a trade or a player submitted an abuse report against you.&nbsp; The MUTE button is perfect for
the first two situations and if you agree to a trade, even if the player said
they would give the item/horse back, be willing to lose that item/horse in case
they are lying.&nbsp; <B>DO NOT file a fake/non-serious abuse report as you will be penalized
instead of the person you had a problem with!</B> - Abuse reports take a lot of time and effort to deal with, And while we appreciate and manage the serious ones, the non-serious ones waste way too much of our time.  The ABUSE REPORT system is a SERIOUS tool, please treat it as such.<br/>
